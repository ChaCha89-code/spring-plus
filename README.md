# 🛠 Backend Project - Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Log

Welcome to my backend project journey!  
This repository documents my **step-by-step troubleshooting log** as I built and refined a Spring Boot application using **JPA**, **AOP**, **JWT**, **QueryDSL**, and more.

The goal was not only to implement features but to understand, debug, and master core backend concepts through hands-on error resolution.
